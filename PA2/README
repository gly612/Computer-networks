I have finished the basic 100 points part and the first part(Congestion control) of Bonus points.
I used many different types of files like pdf, jpg, html and so on. All of them can be transmitted successfully.


For basic part:

I read an input file first and then split the input file into appropriately sized chunks of data.
If not reaching the end of the window, then we send the packet to receiver.
If timeout happens, retransmit the oldest unacknowledged packet.
Upon the receipt of three duplicate acks, we transmit the corresponding packet without waiting for timeout.


For bonus part:

I followed the TCP congestion control mechanism in Slide Transport-5.
There are two cases: loss indicated by timeout and 3 duplicate acks.
I choose to use the mechanism similar to RENO
